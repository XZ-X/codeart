===Artifact Evaluation===

For the artifact evaluation, CodeArt requires `docker` installation.
We provide a runnable docker image for the artifact evaluation.

We recommend using a machine with at least 64GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores.
We also recommend using a machine with an Nvidia GPU having at least 24 GB VRAM.
Our reproduction is tested on A6000 48GB.

Most of the experiments should work fine on a machine with 32GB of RAM and 16GB VRAM.

Running all experiments may require up to 100GB of disk space.
This is because CodeArt checkpoints and datasetsare hosted on Hugging Face and requires downloading them.

The space usage can be reduced with minor engineering efforts.
We will improve it in the future.
